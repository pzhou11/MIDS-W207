    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "3a) K nearest neighbors doesn't work well for this problem due to the lack of close data points in this problem. Most of the neighbors in this dataset are zero and therefore creates a spareness that we did not see in the previous project of number recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3b) Logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes because of overfitting. This dataset has 26879 words in the vocabulary but only 2034 examples. Having more variables than data points leads to overfitting since it is too flexible for the amount of training data that we have. One of the model limitations of logistic regressions compared to naive Bayes is that in logistic regression, a smaller training data could lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3c) As C increases, so does the squared weight values for each class. We are penalizing the model the more complex it becomes. "

    "ANSWER: The unigram results have very high weights for words that are directly relating to the label. In fact, the most highest weighted words all directly relate to the label in some form. The bigram weights are less than the unigram weights. This could be because it appears less frequenctly than unigram words. What is interesting is phrases such as \"you are\", \"was just\", \"and such\", and \"look up\" appear so highly in the bigram model. These phrases all don't stand out as words that would dictate what the topic is about. In the future, excluding common words could provide a better result."

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
